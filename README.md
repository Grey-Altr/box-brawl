# **Project 1 - Browser Game Plan**

### **Note on proposals**
In either of the following projects, I'd like the opportunity to leverage the skills covered at GA, as well as those I had gained and utilized from my prior experience at Alchemy Code Lab, and the Creative Coding AS degree program at Portland Community College while maintaining the scope of this project assignment. Specifically, I'd like the opportunity to utilize the `<canvas>` element to render the projects. Either project will only utilize **HTML**, **CSS** and vanilla **JavaScript**.


## **Proposal 1: Simple Platform Fighter**

This game will be a simple 2-player fighting game, featuring two characters, a static level comprised of a single floating platform. Players attempt to knock each other off of the platform or deplete one another's health.

### **Features and user story**

Player will be able to:

1. Display clear instructions for the control of the player characters.
1. Move forward, backwards, jump and fall with gravity.
1. Attack one another to either knock the opponent off the platform, or deplete the opponents health.
1. Display each players health.

### **Project Schedule**

* **Day 1** - Implement player movement (walking jumping, falling).
* **Day 2** - Implement combat mechanics (attacks, hit detection, knockback).
* **Day 3** - Implement health system and health tracking.
* **Day 4** - Implement level elements (platform and background art) .
* **Day 5** - Debugging and code clean-up.
* **Day 6** - Presentation preparation.

### **Outcome**

By the end of the week, the project will deliver a fully functional, two-player platform fighting game with:

1. Smooth movement and combat mechanics.
1. Real-time health tracking and UI updates.
1. Dynamic stage interaction with platform collisions.
1. Engaging local multiplayer battles.

## **Proposal 2: Snake-style Game**

This game will be a Snake-style game, featuring one character, the Snake; a static level comprised of a top-down square with obstacles, stat tracking, and a timer. Players attempt to collect food before the timer counts down to zero.

### **Features and user story**

Player will be able to:

1. Display clear instructions for the control of the player character.
1. Move along the x and y axes of the the game area.
1. Collect food.
1. Track their stats through on-screen display.
1. Track time remaining for the session.

### **Project Schedule**

* **Day 1** - Implement player movement.
* **Day 2** - Implement items (food).
* **Day 3** - Implement timer.
* **Day 4** - Implement level elements (obstacles, boundaries and background art) .
* **Day 5** - Debugging and  code clean-up.
* **Day 6** - Presentation preparation.

### **Outcome**

By the end of the week, the project will deliver a fully functional, one-player 2D snake-style game:

1. Smooth movement.
1. Real-time time tracking and UI updates.
1. Dynamic stage interaction with obstacle collisions and item collection.
